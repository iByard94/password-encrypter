Encrypter Instructions  
Encrypter is a program that stores your various passwords by keeping them in one, secure location. To ensure security, the saved passwords are encrypted in storage until use. Furthermore, passwords are only accessible by the administrator. 

When the program is first run, it will prompt you for the ADMIN password. This is the password used to unlock all the other saved passwords. (The Description field – the top text field – may be left as “ADMIN” or may be changed).

Next, click the “Add Password” button. The administrator's password is now set, saved, and encrypted as “myAdminPass.” 

To add a password, simply give the password a description in the the top field and enter the password in the field below. 
Passwords may be added indefinitely.


In order to retrieve a stored password, select the description from the list and enter the administrator password. Mine was “myAdminPass.”

Upon the administrator's confirmation, the desired password will be decrypted and passed to your computer's clipboard (never shown directly on the screen). If you wish to delete the selected password, that option is also now revealed.

Finally, the password may now be pasted directly to the desired website.

This program is fairly straight forward and simple, yet I find it helpful in the appropriate circumstance. I conceptualized, programmed, and graphically designed the entirety of this application. I hope you find it useful. Thank you for reading.
